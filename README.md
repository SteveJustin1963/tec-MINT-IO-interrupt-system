# tec-MINT-IO-interrupt-system


CJ;
Sorry its taken so long (you probably already have it?) but I have updated the TEC-1 MINT build to MINT 1.1.

https://github.com/orgMINT/MINT-builds/tree/main/TEC-1_Build

I have added support for the keyboard using NMI interrupt, I will try to do some example code, (I forgot how to use MINT ðŸ˜‚ so it may be a struggle)
